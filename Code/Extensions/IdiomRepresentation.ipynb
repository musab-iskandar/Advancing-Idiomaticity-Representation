        "# This project focuses on advancing idiomatic representation in NLP models by implementing and improving upon methodologies discussed in selected scientific papers. The primary objective is to create a modular and organized codebase for idiomaticity representation, leveraging contrastive triplet loss and adaptive contrastive learning techniques. The dataset involves idioms in both literal and figurative contexts, aiming for tasks such as ranking and idiomaticity detection."
