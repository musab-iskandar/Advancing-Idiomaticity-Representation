# Advancing Multimodal Idiomaticity Representation
## The Problem Definition
Idioms are a class of multi-word expressions (MWE), which pose a challenge for current state-of-the-art models because their meanings are often different from the individual words that compose them. 
For instance, "piece of cake." doesn't typically refer to an actual slice of cake; instead, it refers to something that is easy to do. These expressions may also generate confusion between the literal, surface meaning arising from their component words and the idiomatic meaning. These, among other characteristics, make them a valuable testing ground for examining how NLP models capture meaning.
### We present subtask A:
Static Image: The model will be presented with a set of 5 images with captions and a context sentence in which a particular potentially idiomatic nominal compound (NC) appears. The goal is to rank the images according to how well they represent the sense in which the NC is used in the given context sentence.
Specifically, our goal is to improve the quality of model representations of idiomatic expressions with text only depending on imagesâ€™ captions.
